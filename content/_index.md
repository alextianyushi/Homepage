## About Me

Hello! I’m Tianyu Shi, a graduate student at the University of British Columbia under the supervision of [Prof. Chen Feng](https://sites.google.com/view/chenfeng-ubc/). I’m also a member of [Blockchain@UBC](https://blockchain.ubc.ca/). My research interests lie in stochastic processes, blockchain protocols, and AI agents. I received my Bachelor of Applied Science in Electrical Engineering from UBC.
